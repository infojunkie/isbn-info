2.1 Summary
In 2002, the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) estimated that over
three million publicly accessible websites existed on the World Wide Web
(O’Neill et al. 2003, para. 9). In the material world of information, this
number would approximate from 14 to 28 million books, matching or exceeding the number of volumes held by most of the world’s largest libraries. This overwhelming collection of information represents an endless,
accessible supply of both verbal and visual data for scholars interested in
studying online activity. And although the sheer volume of available resources on the Web has presented the challenge of choosing what to study
and how to study, the Web has proven even more daunting. In this chapter,
we will provide an overview of methodological approaches researchers
have used to study the Web.
The goal in doing so is not to provide an exhaustive categorization of
methodologies. Instead, it is our hope that by understanding the methods
used for studying the Web and studying Web use, those who seek to archive and preserve the Web can better understand the needs of the research
community.
The Web consists of an immense variety of types of materials whose variety is best understood along two dimensions. First, the Web itself is a
medium, and not simply content. More to the point, it is both a medium
that conveys content via numerous protocols (such as HTTP), and it is also
a “container” for content, one which further “shapes” content and also presents it to viewers. However, the presentation of content is at the viewer’s
discretion and is further shaped by the viewing tools used (browsers and
other applications). In other words, though the content may be the same
Web page, two viewers using different browsers or using different browser
settings may ultimately see different pages. Second, and further unlike the

56

world of analog materials, the very definition of media for storing the Web
is open to question. Websites can be locally stored or cached, may be mirrored, may be dynamic, or may be virtually ephemeral, as is the case with
Web cams.
Internet research, in general, and Web research, in particular, is populated by a diverse group of scholars. Their various disciplines include linguistics, journalism, political science, business administration, geography,
advertising, communication, and the arts, to name only a few. Because we
are dealing with such a wide array of academic traditions, the types of materials with which they work are very diverse, and the working definitions
of research methods vary as well. What counts as “ethnographic” analysis
of Web texts for a marketing scholar may be interpreted as a qualitative
content analysis by a communication scholar. Therefore, another goal of
this chapter is not to provide rigid Web content categories or blueprints for
each methodological approach as they apply to Web studies, but rather to
present a range of interpretations and applications of these methods as they
have proven most useful to researchers of the Web.

2.2 Content Analysis
Content analysis is one of the more common methods for studying the
Web. As with other media, a researcher who uses content analysis codes
Web content, either written text or images, based on particular criteria and
places them within relevant categories or themes; in other words, it is a
survey of Web content, rather than Web users. Within Web studies, content analysis has primarily been used as a comparative tool, allowing the
researcher to make meaningful comparisons of content between similar
Web texts. A study of antiglobalization organizations’ websites used content analysis to determine whether cohesion in message and purpose existed among the sites (Van Aelst and Walgrave 2002). Content was coded
and sorted based on what appeared to be its primary function within four
areas: to provide information about the organization, to provide information about antiglobalization issues, to foster interactivity with the group
organizers and other members, and to foster mobilization on behalf of the
cause, such as donating money signing an online petition. Through their
analysis, Van Aelst and Walgrave were able to conclude that indeed, antiglobalizations organizations online were generally using their websites in
similar ways to inform and involve their memberships.
Another comparative study analyzed the content of radio station websites to determine how the commercial radio industry was responding to

2 Web Use and Web Studies

the availability of the World Wide Web for promoting their stations. This
assessment was made by analyzing the types of user-based information being provided on radio stations’ websites (e.g., traffic maps and program
logs), their use of websites as tools for promoting their station (e.g., contest information and DJ bios), and their incorporation of interactive features (e.g., e-mail addresses for the stations’ staff members and listener
surveys) (Pitts and Harms 2003). For radio stations, this Web study provided a valuable resource for evaluating their current and potential uses of
the Web.
Content analysis has also been used to study the impact of institutional
policy changes on related websites. Educational policies, for example,
have placed increasing importance on the incorporation of information and
communications technology (ICT) into secondary schools’ institutional
missions. One study chose to evaluate the progress being made toward
achieving this goal as outlined by the National Grid for Learning in the UK
through a content analysis of 150 secondary school websites (Hesketh and
Selwyn 1999). Images and written texts were coded, identifying the websites within one of the following attitude categories: Proactive, pupilcentered, or reactive. Through these categories and an analysis of the
schools’ profiles, the researchers recognized a correlation between a commitment to ICT integration and institutional capital; the more economic
and social capital a school had, the more likely that their website’s content
would reflect a positive, proactive attitude toward the incorporation of ICT
in their mission.
The US Federal Trade Commission has employed content analysis to
evaluate the implementation of online privacy and information security notices on commercial websites (Milne and Culnan 2002). Their study comprised a longitudinal analysis of four Web “surveys” spanning from 1998
to 2001. Criteria such as the inclusion or exclusion of notices regarding the
disclosure of visitor information with third parties and use of “cookies,”
collection of user information beyond e-mail addresses, and the use of information security on the sites were used to determine whether the websites met the requirements of fair information practices. The results from
the 2001 analysis were also compared with previous years and indicated that
among commercial websites that collect personal information from their users there has been an increase in the implementation of fair information
practices (p. 355).
