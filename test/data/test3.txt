Brain-Computer Interfaces
Neurorehabilitation of Voluntary Movement after
Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury

BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES

Stroke and spinal cord injury often result in paralysis with serious negative consequences to the independence
and quality of life of those who sustain them. For these individuals, rehabilitation provides the means to
regain lost function. Rehabilitation following neurological injuries has undergone revolutionary changes,
enriched by neuroplasticity. Neuroplastic-based interventions enhance the efficacy and continue to guide
the development of new rehabilitation strategies. This book presents three important technology-based
rehabilitation interventions that follow the concepts of neuroplasticity. The book also discusses clinical results
related to their efficacy. These interventions are: functional electrical stimulation therapy, which produces
coordinated muscle contractions allowing people with paralysis to perform functional movements with
rich sensory feedback; robot-assisted therapy, which uses robots to assist, resist, and guide movements with
increased intensity while also reducing the physical burden on therapists; and brain–computer interfaces,
which make it possible to verify the presence of motor-related brain activity during rehabilitation. Further,
the book presents the combined use of these three technologies to illustrate some of the emerging approaches
to the neurorehabilitation of voluntary movement. The authors share their practical experiences obtained
during the development and clinical testing of functional electrical stimulation therapy controlled by a brain–
computer interface as an intervention to restore reaching and grasping.

This series provides state-of-the-art overview lectures on assistive technologies. We take a broad
view of this expanding field, defining it as information and communications technologies used in
diagnosis and treatment, prosthetics that compensate for impaired capabilities, methods for rehabilitating or restoring function, and protective interventions that enable individuals to stay healthy
for longer periods of time.
Each overview introduces the medical context in which technology is used, presents and
explains the technology; reviews problems and opportunities, successes and failures in the development and use of technology; and synthesizes promising opportunities for future progress. Authors
include significant material based on their own work, while surveying the broad landscape of an
area’s research, development, and deployment progress and success.

ABSTRACT

Stroke and spinal cord injury often result in paralysis with serious negative consequences to the
independence and quality of life of those who sustain them. For these individuals, rehabilitation
provides the means to regain lost function. Rehabilitation following neurological injuries has
undergone revolutionary changes, enriched by neuroplasticity. Neuroplastic-based interventions
enhance the efficacy and continue to guide the development of new rehabilitation strategies.
This book presents three important technology-based rehabilitation interventions that follow the
concepts of neuroplasticity. The book also discusses clinical results related to their efficacy. These
interventions are: functional electrical stimulation therapy, which produces coordinated muscle
contractions allowing people with paralysis to perform functional movements with rich sensory
feedback; robot-assisted therapy, which uses robots to assist, resist, and guide movements with
increased intensity while also reducing the physical burden on therapists; and brain–computer
interfaces, which make it possible to verify the presence of motor-related brain activity during
rehabilitation. Further, the book presents the combined use of these three technologies to illustrate
some of the emerging approaches to the neurorehabilitation of voluntary movement. The authors
share their practical experiences obtained during the development and clinical testing of functional
electrical stimulation therapy controlled by a brain–computer interface as an intervention to restore
reaching and grasping.
